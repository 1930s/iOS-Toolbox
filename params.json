{"name":"iOS Toolbox","tagline":"my iOS dev toolbox","body":"# Prologue #\r\n\r\nIn software development, especially mobile developement is rapidly improved. And as a software developer, I think there're always many thing for us to learn everyday. \r\n\r\nBeing able to keep track of what's news in technology today is really difficult, it's daunting, not to say an impossible task; but we can't help but have to keep being updated. Besides, information overloaded should be avoided. \r\n\r\nHow we manage to find informations, how we can seperate them into small priorities/categories, how we use our tools to make the most of them; there are so many hows?\r\n\r\nBut the answer is, to me, we just need to learn what matters us the most, and group them in a list or something like that. I call it a 'toolbox'. \r\n\r\nHere is my a list of my personal iOS developement toolbox. Hope some find it useful\r\n\r\n### Inspired by ###\r\n+ Stanislaw Pankevich's iOS Project Catalogue: https://github.com/stanislaw/iOS-Projects-Catalogue\r\n+ Eduardo Diaz Sancha's 'What's in my iOS toolbox': http://edsancha.com/blog/2014/01/28/whats-in-my-iOS-toolbox.html\r\n+ Ben Scheirman's 'The iOS developers Toolbelt': http://benscheirman.com/2013/08/the-ios-developers-toolbelt/\r\n+ Phat Le at 2359 Media's throughout list 'iOS Topics and Reference': https://github.com/2359media/ios-dev-guide/blob/master/iOS%20Topics%20and%20References.md\r\n\r\nCan't miss:\r\n+ [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)\r\n+ [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) -- huge time saver, the one and only tool to help us manage Objective-C dependencies. If possible, don't do drag and drop into Xcode project, use `pod install` instead. I've been using it in all of [my apps](http://gist.io/7972328) on the iTunes App Store.\r\n+ objc.io -> http://www.objc.io/subscribe.html <-\r\n\r\nAlso, \r\nCocoapods new pod feeds to email -- Newsletter-like:\r\n+ I'm a [Feer of Missing Out -- FOMO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) kind of person. And since there is dozens of interesting new pods everyday, it easy to miss something great, and I want to try something new very early. So I create this IFTTT recipe to help me do just that >> https://ifttt.com/recipes/132717-notify-new-pods-via-email\r\n\r\nBlogs/sites:\r\n+ NSHipster\r\n+ NSBlog\r\n+ idevblogaday\r\n+ iOSDeveloperTip\r\n+ http://www.alexcurylo.com/blog/\r\n+ TeehanLax\r\n+ RayWenderlich\r\n+ Mobile Tuts+\r\n+ Cocoacontrols.com\r\n\r\nTwitter accounts you should be following, in no particular orders:\r\n+ @mikeash\r\n+ @mattt\r\n+ @ctp\r\n+ @casademora\r\n+ @steipete\r\n+ @nicklockwood\r\n+ @eridius\r\n+ @samvermette\r\n+ @evadne\r\n+ @secboffin\r\n+ @markaufflick\r\n+ @mattgemmell\r\n+ @jnjosh\r\n+ @danmessing\r\n+ @drewmccormack\r\n+ @ntakayama\r\n+ @chrismiles\r\n+ @kevinhoctor\r\n+ @timburks\r\n+ @borkware\r\n+ @parisba\r\n+ @Jury\r\n+ @joshaber\r\n+ @AshFurrow\r\n+ @Javi and @NachoSoto\r\n+ @uliwitness\r\n+ @stroughtonsmith\r\n+ @rob_rix\r\n+ @codinghorror\r\n+ @tonyarnold\r\n+ @alding\r\n+ ...\r\n\r\nNewsletter:\r\n+ iOS Goodies http://ios-goodies.tumblr.com/rss, IFTTT recipe: https://ifttt.com/recipes/143200-ios-goodies-blog\r\n+ ManiacDev.Com\r\n+ Dailybbble, help find me app design inspiration http://dailybbble.herokuapp.com/\r\n+ Apple Mailing List, particularly objc-language-request, xcode-users-request: https://lists.apple.com/\r\n+ GihubArchive: http://www.githubarchive.org/\r\n+ Github Explore: https://github.com/explore/subscribe\r\n+ StackExchange Programmers Weekly: http://stackexchange.com/newsletters\r\n+ StackExchange StackOverflow Weekly: http://stackexchange.com/newsletters\r\n\r\nPodcast:\r\n+ NSBrief\r\n+ iphreaksshow\r\n+ ThoughtBot BuildPhase\r\n+ RayWenderlich\r\n+ JellyStyle MobileCouch\r\n\r\nIDE:\r\n+ Xcode\r\n+ AppCode\r\n\r\nFor Xcode Package Managament, I highly reccommended [Alcatraz](http://mneorr.github.io/Alcatraz/), It is something you don't want to miss in your Xcode dev arsenal.\r\n\r\nText Edtior:\r\n+ SublimeText\r\n+ MacVim\r\n+ ...\r\n\r\nStyle guides:\r\n+ NYTimes: https://github.com/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide\r\n+ GitHub: https://github.com/github/objective-c-conventions\r\n+ Google: http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/objcguide.xml\r\n+ ...\r\n\r\nCheatsheet:\r\n+ RayWenderlich's: [PDF] http://cdn1.raywenderlich.com/downloads/RW-Objective-C-Cheatsheet-v-1-5.pdf\r\n+ Rob Phillips's: https://github.com/iwasrobbed/Objective-C-CheatSheet\r\n\r\nAnalytics:\r\n+ Google Analytics (my personal favorite)\r\n+ Flurry\r\n+ ...\r\n\r\nCrash report:\r\n+ Crashlytics\r\n+ ...\r\n\r\nLogging:\r\n+ CocoaLumberjack\r\n+ NSLogger: https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger\r\n+ ...\r\n\r\nCustomers service:\r\n+ UserVoice: https://www.uservoice.com/\r\n+ Apptentive\r\n+ ...\r\n\r\nIcon fonts:\r\n+ ion icons: http://ionicons.com/ -- my favorite.
