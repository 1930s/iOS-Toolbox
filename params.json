Nowadays, they are things that are unthinkable as of several years ago.\r\n\r\nThe world is moving to mobile. And as a (newbie) mobile software/iOS developer, I think there're always many thing for us to learn everyday.\r\n\r\nBeing able to keep track of what's new in technology today is really difficult, it's daunting, not to say an impossible task; but we can't help but have to keep being updated, unless we want to be left behind. \r\n\r\nBesides, information overload should be avoided. We all have works to do, and life to enjoy! :) \r\n\r\nSo, how we manage to find informations, how we can separate them into small priorities/categories, or how we use our tools to make the most of them; there are so many \"how\"s.\r\n\r\nBut the answer, to me, is rather simple, let say we just need to learn what matters us the most, and better group them in a list or something like that. I call it 'toolbox'.\r\n\r\nHere is my a list of my personal iOS development toolbox. I hope it useful for you somewhat! Feel free to add yours. :)\r\n\r\n**(Note: All list items are arranged in no particular order)**\r\n\r\nLet's get started! :rocket:\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### References ###\r\n\r\n+ What's in my iOS toolbox: [part 1](http://edsancha.com/blog/2014/01/28/whats-in-my-iOS-toolbox.html), [part 2](http://edsancha.com/blog/2014/02/03/whats-in-my-iOS-toolbox-2.html) by Eduardo Diaz Sancha.\r\n+ [iOS Dev Toolbox](http://ios.devtools.me/) :star::star::star::star::star:\r\n+ [Recommended Toolbox for iOS](http://www.fantageek.com/1021/recommended-toolbox-for-ios/)\r\n+ [Resources for Mac and iOS Developers](http://www.davemark.com/?p=1829)\r\n+ [The iOS developers Toolbelt](http://benscheirman.com/2013/08/the-ios-developers-toolbelt/) by [Ben Scheirman](https://github.com/subdigital).\r\n+ [iOS Project Catalogue](https://github.com/stanislaw/iOS-Projects-Catalogue) by [Stanislaw Pankevich](https://github.com/stanislaw).\r\n+ [iOS Topics and Reference](https://github.com/2359media/ios-dev-guide/blob/master/iOS%20Topics%20and%20References.md) by [Phat Le](https://github.com/phatle).\r\n+ [iOS Dev Tools](https://github.com/EvgenyKarkan/iOSDevTools) by [Evgeny Karkan](https://github.com/EvgenyKarkan).\r\n+ [iOS Apprentice](https://medium.com/ios-apprentice/ba312d12577d) by [James Tang](https://github.com/jamztang)\r\n+ [iOS: Tools of the Trade](http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/ios-tools-of-the-trade--cms-19820)\r\n+ iOS Dev Tools by Krzysztof Zab≈Çocki [slide](https://speakerdeck.com/krzysztofzablocki/ios-developer-tools-at-london-alttechtalk) | [blog post](http://www.merowing.info/2014/02/ios-developer-tools/)\r\n+ [Mobile App Development Resources Guide](http://joppar.com/mobile-app-development-resources-guide/)\r\n+ [Worthy iOS Library](http://bpoplauschi.wordpress.com/2013/11/06/worthy-ios-libraries/)\r\n+ [Worthy iOS Development Tools](http://bpoplauschi.wordpress.com/2014/03/07/worthy-ios-development-tools/)\r\n+ [Dev Toolbelt](http://gimenete.github.io/devtoolbelt/index.html)\r\n+ [iOS Good Practice](https://github.com/futurice/ios-good-practices)\r\n\r\n## Can't miss ##\r\n\r\n+ [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) -- words!\r\n+ [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) -- huge time saver, the one and only tool to help us manage Objective-C dependencies.
